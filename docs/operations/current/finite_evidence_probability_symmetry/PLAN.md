# finite_evidence_probability_symmetry -- Plan

Date: 2026-07-11
Branch: `p2-pending-exit-restart-redecision`
Status: active

## Background

Current live source-clock posteriors display Normal point complements near
`0.999`, while the executable uncertainty carrier conditions on that Normal
family and can grant NO certainty unsupported by the finite current evidence.
The same path still applies a settlement-fitted historical far-tail q_lcb cap to
YES, contrary to the current-evidence-only probability law and the operator's
first-principles constraint.

## Scope

Money path: current source shape -> settlement-preimage point q -> coherent
current-evidence band -> symmetric YES/NO samples -> global lower-CVaR order
selection. Harmonizes executable source, the active replacement authority, and
test topology under INV-06 and INV-41; supersedes no independent authority.

The live proof loop also owns one execution-liveness defect discovered after
deployment: command recovery opened TRADE as MAIN with WORLD attached, while
price-channel opened WORLD as MAIN with TRADE attached. Concurrent
``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` calls therefore reserved the two WAL writers in opposite
orders. The repair must make command-recovery hold the existing canonical
WORLD+TRADE live flocks for each short apply transaction; increasing timeouts or
editing processing rows is outside scope.

## Deliverables
- Keep Normal `q_json` as an immutable point estimate, never as executable certainty.
- Widen the shared simplex carrier by the exact 51-member zero-hit limit and the
  distribution-free Cantelli limit from current mean/variance.
- Remove historical far-tail floors from the source-clock route; preserve them
  only for explicitly non-source-clock compatibility paths.
- Preserve Day0 absorbing physical facts as dominant.
- Commit, deploy through the official restart path, then prove the result from a
  newly materialized canonical posterior and live auction/order receipts.
- Remove the WORLD/TRADE writer-order inversion that prevents the corrected
  probability carrier from reaching live redecision.

## Verification
- Focused first-principles antibody and settlement-preimage regressions pass.
- All carrier rows sum to one; NO lower-CVaR is the pointwise complement and does
  not exceed `1 - q_ucb_required`.
- Pure builder over current canonical Guangzhou 39C inputs changes executable NO
  confidence without changing its Normal point q.
- Existing global capital-optimality evaluator passes; fresh runtime evidence is
  required separately from tests.
- POSIX WAL-byte evidence shows no simultaneous opposite-order WORLD/TRADE
  writer hold after restart; reactor cycles progress beyond claim bounces.

## Work record

- 2026-07-11: live rows isolated the source-clock YES historical-floor / NO
  near-one asymmetry.
- 2026-07-11: first implementation's zero-hit-only member bound was rejected:
  current member values now remain in-memory and exact settlement-preimage hit
  counts drive Clopper-Pearson UCBs; provenance persists their hash/count/hits.
- 2026-07-11: current canonical posterior 32089 / snapshot 1203438,
  Guangzhou Jul 12 39C, has 0/51 hits, Normal NO point 0.999915, but current-
  evidence NO LCB and 5% lower-CVaR 0.933965; all 400 carrier rows remain simplex.
- 2026-07-11: focused antibody 3/3, current source-clock contracts 7/7, and
  global capital-optimality evaluator 226/226 passed before final deploy audit.
- 2026-07-11: live WAL byte-range locks isolated an execution deadlock:
  price-channel held WORLD while main held TRADE; command recovery and
  price-channel used opposite MAIN/ATTACH order. No DB rows were edited.
