# EMOS affine center calibration — before/after (2026-07-01)

Walk-forward (leak-free) on the REAL runtime combined center. BEFORE = served runtime center; AFTER =
affine-corrected μ'=a+b·μ (shrunk-to-identity, slope clamped [0.85,1.15]). 19 served cities, N=2069
settled cells, σ=1.48 (pooled realized). Every served city improves on RMSE, CRPS, and bin log-loss.

## Pooled
| metric | BEFORE | AFTER | improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMSE | 1.633 | 1.441 | **+11.8%** |
| MAE | 1.276 | 1.101 | +13.7% |
| \|bias\| | 0.690 | 0.311 | halved |
| CRPS (proper score) | 0.910 | 0.794 | **+12.8%** |
| settlement-bin log-loss (q on realized bin) | 1.922 | 1.792 | +6.8% |
| 90% coverage | 87.4% | 91.3% | → 90 target (calibration up) |

- Served-set (19) ΔMSE = 1.633²−1.441² = **+0.590** (block CI [+0.49,+0.69]); the +0.327 figure is a
  DIFFERENT mask (all 50 cities incl. the identity ones). Both are correct — quoted separately here to
  fix the metric-mask ambiguity the consult flagged [BLOCKER].
- Live single_runs transfer (the actual served product): pooled ΔMSE +0.228 / 909 cells, 33/49 cities
  improve — the affine transfers to the ifs9 product (a constant offset did not: it harmed 4).

## Consult verification (REQ-20260701-034919, Pro Extended) — verdict REVISE→conditions cleared locally
The consult confirmed the affine is the RIGHT family (E[s−μ|μ]=a+(b−1)μ, so a+bμ is aligned; a constant
offset assumes b=1) and asked for a harder audit. All of it cleared locally:
- **Out-of-fold σ** (walk-forward σ from prior residuals only, same σ before/after): CRPS 0.912→0.789
  (+13.4%), bin-LL 1.936→1.777 (+8.2%), 90% cov 84.4→89.6 — the distributional gains SURVIVE OOF σ.
- **Nested blocked policy replay** (select served units on the EARLY 60% only; score the UNTOUCHED late
  40%): outer-block ΔMSE **+0.796, date-block CI [+0.595,+1.008], excludes 0**; CRPS +16.5%. → the
  selection policy GENERALIZES (not post-selection optimism).
- **Threshold-wise Brier** at operational cutpoints round(μ)+{−1,0,+1,+2}: ALL positive, worst +0.005 →
  NO decision threshold harmed (the consult's sharpest "CRPS-up but decisions-worse" test).
- **Transfer-gate tightening** [HIGH]: production now requires the transfer 95% lower-CI, not a point.
  → **PRODUCTION tier = 12 units** (Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Dallas, Guangzhou, Kuala Lumpur,
  Los Angeles, Milan, Munich, Taipei, Toronto, Wellington), served-pooled ΔMSE +0.436 CI [+0.33,+0.55].
  **CANARY tier = 7** (Ankara, Atlanta, Hong Kong, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Wuhan) — serve=False
  (inert live), accruing live obs until their transfer CI tightens.
Open follow-ups (consult, non-blocking): hierarchical partial-pool vs per-unit affine comparison; the
full nested bootstrap that redoes selection inside each replicate; edge-case unit tests + kill switch.

Corrections are tiny in mild conditions (median served |b−1|=0.046, 32 non-served cities identical) and
precise only in extremes (Taipei −0.3@21°C → +1.9@37°C where all models genuinely lag). σ untouched.
