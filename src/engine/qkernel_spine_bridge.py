"""qkernel_spine_bridge — the Wave-5B cutover bridge from the live reactor to the
rebuilt q-kernel spine.

This module is the ONLY place the reactor's per-family decision is routed through
``src/decision/family_decision_engine.FamilyDecisionEngine.decide()``. It exists so
the reactor seam edit stays a single ``if/else`` branch: when the
``qkernel_spine_enabled`` flag is ON, the reactor calls
:func:`decide_family_via_spine` here; when OFF, the legacy decision path runs
byte-for-byte unchanged and NOTHING in this module is imported on the hot path.

WHAT IT DOES (the cutover contract):

  1. ``qkernel_spine_enabled()`` — reads the single boolean cutover flag from
     ``settings["feature_flags"]["qkernel_spine_enabled"]`` (default False) using the
     SAME accessor the other reactor flags use (no new config mechanism). A config
     read fault keeps the OFF default (fail-closed to legacy).

  2. ``decide_family_via_spine(...)`` — builds the spine inputs from the
     reactor-native data already in scope at the ``_generate_candidate_proofs`` /
     ``_selected_candidate_proof`` orchestration seam (the family, the per-candidate
     ``_CandidateProof`` tuple already materialized for the submission pipeline, the
     threaded ``_edli_spine_*`` predictive center/dispersion/members, the existing
     family exposure), calls ``FamilyDecisionEngine.decide()`` (the rebuilt spine:
     predictive_distribution -> joint_q -> joint_q_band -> family_book ->
     market_coherence -> negrisk_routes -> payoff_vector -> filter[direction,
     coherence, edge_lcb>0 & delta_u>0] -> argmax optimal_delta_u), and maps the
     resulting ``FamilyDecision.selected`` back onto the matching ``_CandidateProof``
     so the reactor's submission pipeline (RiskGuard, freshness, MECE fail-closed,
     venue submission, receipts, the Stage-0 decision_receipt_spine) wraps it
     unchanged.

THE SUBMISSION PIPELINE IS NOT TOUCHED. This bridge replaces the DECISION
COMPUTATION (which q, which candidate, what size), not the submission machinery. The
reactor still owns RiskGuard, freshness/staleness gates, MECE fail-closed, venue
submission, receipt persistence. The honest pre-existing gates (direction law,
capital-efficiency q_lcb>price = the engine's ``edge_lcb>0``, real fee+tick,
settlement truth) STAY: the spine's own ``decide()`` filter chain (direction law +
coherence + edge_lcb>0 & optimal_delta_u>0) IS the capital-efficiency law, and the
selected proof still flows through the reactor's downstream submit-time re-proofs.

DRIFT RESOLVED (recorded per operator law — see impl_w5b_integration.md §"Input mapping"):

  * The VALIDATED belief authority runs at the seam. The spine builds the ONE
    predictive distribution via the REAL ``PredictiveDistributionBuilder`` —
    ``build_center`` (envelope-locked) + ``build_sigma`` (realized-floor) — over the
    reactor's chain-of-record-DEBIASED members (threaded under
    ``_edli_spine_debiased_members_native`` by the Stage-0 producer). This is the
    ARM-replay-validated center+σ (center PROVEN, σ honest std(z)=0.93; see
    docs/rebuild/arm_replay_report.md), NOT the reactor's legacy served mu*/σ. The
    reactor's served mu*/σ are the LEGACY EMOS/replacement values being replaced — they
    are no longer used for belief. De-bias is a no-op at the seam (``_NoOpDebiasAuthority``):
    the chain-of-record per-model de-bias already ran upstream (the single correct
    de-bias; the contaminating EDLI lane is OFF), and the reactor does not thread the
    member provenance the real ``DebiasAuthority`` would need to safely re-run here —
    so the seam applies NO further shift (no double-de-bias). Wiring the full
    ``DebiasAuthority`` on RAW members with provenance is a follow-up that only changes
    behavior where a per-city artifact would diverge from the already-validated
    chain-of-record debias. If the reactor served no debiased members at all (the
    threaded inputs are absent — a genuine reconstruction gap), the bridge returns a
    TYPED no-trade (``SPINE_INPUTS_UNAVAILABLE``) rather than fabricating a center.

  * The spine's ``family_book`` step consumes ``ExecutableMarketSnapshot`` per
    sibling keyed by bin_id. The reactor's per-family decision seam holds the
    executable snapshot ROWS (DB row dicts) and the per-candidate ``_CandidateProof``
    objects, not reconstructed ``ExecutableMarketSnapshot`` objects. Resolution: the
    bridge does NOT rebuild the family book from raw rows. The reactor's selection
    geometry (the ΔU ranker over ``NativeSideCandidate`` sizing objects + the
    ``FamilyPayoffMatrix`` over the family bins + the ``PortfolioExposureVector``) is
    the SAME ``utility_ranker`` geometry the spine's payoff layer maximizes over, and
    the per-candidate executable cost curves are already materialized on the proofs.
    The bridge therefore drives ``decide()`` with the reactor-native sizing
    candidates and exposure (the real spine types) and lets the spine own the
    direction-law + coherence + edge + argmax-ΔU selection over them. The market book
    used for coherence is assembled from the per-candidate proofs' executable prices
    (the de-frictioned market q the coherence module needs), recorded in the report
    as the resolved family-book input.

EVERY PATH RETURNS A TYPED OUTCOME. A trade selects a proof; a no-trade carries a
typed ``no_trade_reason`` (the spine's own vocabulary or ``SPINE_INPUTS_UNAVAILABLE``
when a required input genuinely cannot be reconstructed). The bridge never raises a
bare exception into the reactor's hot path — a wiring fault is caught and returned as
a typed ``SPINE_WIRING_FAULT`` no-trade so the reactor emits a deterministic receipt.

    This is the resolved family-book input (see module docstring). The reactor's

    (``orderbook_depth_json`` / ``orderbook_depth_jsonb``) into a ``MarketBook`` — the
    SAME native ladders the reactor priced each proof's ``execution_price`` against. So
    the route set / candidate economics the spine computes walk the SAME books the
    reactor's q-build saw, with no second capture and no snapshot reconstruction.

    already submits this. ``negrisk_routes`` direct-NO walks the NO ASK (taker), which
    DISCARDS that maker edge. So in v1 the route surface is NOT built off the ask ladder:
    each reactor ``_CandidateProof`` IS one direct-native route, and its cost is the
